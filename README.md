## ‚úÖ Requirements Met

- [x] Trending Movie List
- [x] Search with debounce
- [x] Paging for both search & trending
- [x] Movie Detail Page
- [x] Open homepage URL in browser
- [x] Offline cache: trending + detail
- [x] Error Handling: offline, API failure, empty state
- [x] Clean Architecture + DI + Compose

---

## üß† Notes

- **Debounce + FlatMapLatest** used for smooth search experience
- Movie detail is saved offline after viewing
- Trending data is cached for 1 hour to avoid frequent API calls
- Switching between local and remote paging is dynamic

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Initially, the goal was to build this app using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) and SQLDelight for shared business logic and local caching. However, due to compatibility issues between the latest Android Studio (Narwhal | 2025.1.1) and SQLDelight 2.x, and the limited time frame for the technical test, I reverted to a full native Android-only implementation using Room for offline persistence.
KMM setup and SQLDelight caching would be explored further if more time and IDE compatibility were available.
